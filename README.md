# Data Structure and Data Modelling
I gathered the dataset used from Code Basics’ website.

The datasets contain Two types of tables -->

Fact table: Transaction data.

• dim_date
• dim_hotels
• dim_rooms
• fact_aggregated_bookings
• fact_bookings

Here is the Datamodel that I have worked on and it's a STAR SCHEMA
